# SWJS
A cutting-edge traffic management system based on large-language model. Integration of LLMS with existing data sources to enhance traffic flows, slash congestion, and boost green mobility.

Before use:
Run `make install ` to download the dependencies. (If your development introduce new dependencies, remember to update the `requirements.txt` file).

(Optional) If your development involves open_ai end point, copy and rename the `.env.dev` to `.env` and add real API key. DO NOT hardcode and commit your api_key (and other secrets?) anytime.
